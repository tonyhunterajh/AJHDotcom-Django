          Are you becoming more and more frustrated with trying to live the Christian life in faith?  Many 
          Christians are constantly told to have faith, they are criticized for not having enough faith, and they 
          are even condemned for having no faith at all.  This book will help every Christian learn how to live a 
          life of biblical faith!  In this book you will learn Godâ€™s framework for faith; you will learn what 
          faith means, what faith is, and how faith works. You no longer have to wonder if you have faith or not, 
          or if your faith is strong enough; this book will give you clarity and assurance about living a life of 
          true biblical faith in God.
